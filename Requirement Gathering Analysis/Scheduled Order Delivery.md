## General Clarification Questions

* Who are the primary users of this feature?
* Will this option be available for all products or only selected categories?
* How should this option appear in the user interface?

## Functional Requirement Clarifications

* Should users be able to edit or cancel their scheduled delivery after placing the order?
* What is the maximum number of days in advance a delivery can be scheduled?

## Outcome of Requirement Gathering

By asking structured clarification questions across general understanding, functional needs, non-functional requirements, and edge cases, the ambiguities around the Scheduled Order Delivery feature were minimized. This analysis ensures that the solution is **user-friendly, technically feasible, and scalable**. The requirement gathering process lays a strong foundation for design, development, and smoother stakeholder alignment moving forward.
