# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Analyst Portfolio**!  
This repository showcases my problem-solving skills across different types of analyses that a data analyst or associate product analyst would typically perform.  
Each folder contains a structured case study with problem statements, thought process, and solutions written in a clear and professional way.

##  What’s Inside

###  Ad-hoc Analysis
- Quick, one-time analyses performed to answer specific business questions.  
- Example: Investigating sudden spikes or drops in user engagement.

###  Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- Deep dives to identify the underlying cause behind a business problem.  
- Example: Why did sales drop in a particular region? Why did retention fall in a specific user segment?

### Requirement Gathering Analysis
- Structured clarification questions for new feature development.  
- Example: **Scheduled Order Delivery** feature — including general clarifications, functional & non-functional requirements, and edge cases.

## Skills Highlighted
- **SQL**: Writing queries for RCA and ad-hoc analysis.  
- **Analytical Thinking**: Breaking down ambiguous problems into smaller, answerable questions.  
- **Requirement Gathering**: Asking the right clarifying questions to capture business, functional, and non-functional needs.  
- **Documentation**: Presenting insights in a clear, case-study format.

## Purpose of this Portfolio
This portfolio is meant to demonstrate my **analytical approach, structured problem-solving, and communication skills** — even without access to real company data.  
It reflects how I would work on real business problems, document insights, and present them in a professional way.
